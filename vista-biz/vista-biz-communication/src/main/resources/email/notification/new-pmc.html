<p>Hello ${ownerName},</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Property Vista as your Property Management Software Solution. Your account has now been activated and you can start using Property Vista immediately at:</p>
<a href="${crmLink}">${crmLink}</a>
<p>The Property Vista Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software is the internal part of your system. Through it you can add buildings, units, leases, tenants, and much more. You can also personalize your Resident Portal Site from within the CRM.</p>
<p>The myCommunity Resident Portal Site is the site for your current residents. Current residents can use the Portal to submit maintenance requests, pay their rent online, buy renters insurance and much more. It can be accessed by your residents here:</p>
<a href="${portalLink}">${portalLink}</a>
<p>Since the system is still in it's initial stages, some features may not be functional at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience but assure you that we are working on getting all features and functions up and going as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you are interested in our newest features such as Property Vista’s Online Application system or doing Credit Checks on Prospective Residents please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@propertyvista.com">info@propertyvista.com</a> to get further details about pricing and setup.</p>
<p>Below you can find a demo version of both the Property Vista CRM and the myCommunity Resident Portal to give you an idea of what your site could look like:</p>
