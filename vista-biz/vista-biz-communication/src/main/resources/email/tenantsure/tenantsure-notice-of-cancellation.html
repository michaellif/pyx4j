<p>Dear ${tenantFirstName},</p>
<p>
It has come to our attention that your current premiums have not been paid as per the policy conditions.
Thus, this email serves as Notice Of Cancellation for Non-Payment of Premium effective ${cancellationDate}.
The premium payment deadline is ${gracePeriodEndDate}. If you pay before ${gracePeriodEndDate} then please disregard this notice. 
To resolve this issue, simply log in to your <a href="${paymentMethodLink}">Resident Portal</a> to put in your current payment information.

<p>
If coverage is cancelled, your landlord will be notified within their rights as an Additional Insured under your policy. You may also be in breach of your lease obligations which could lead to eviction
