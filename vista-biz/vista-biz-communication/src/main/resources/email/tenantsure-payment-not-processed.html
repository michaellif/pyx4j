<p>Dear Tenantsure customer,</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that your current premiums have not been paid as per the policy conditions. Thus, this email serves as Notice Of Cancellation for Non-Payment of Premium. The service expires on ${periodEndDate}</p>
<p>Please log in to your <a href="${paymentMethodLink}">Resident Portal</a> to put in current payment information to activate payments otherwise your coverage will be cancelled. If coverage is cancelled, your landlord will be notified according to their right of notice as an Additional Insured under your policy and you may also be in breach of your lease obligations which could lead to eviction.</p>
