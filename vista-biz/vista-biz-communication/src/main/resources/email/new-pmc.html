<p>The Property Vista Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software is the internal part of your system. Through it you can add buildings, units, leases, tenants, and much more. You can also personalize your Resident Portal Site from the CRM.</p>
<p>The Resident Portal Site is the site for future and current tenants. Future tenants will be able to view buildings, available units, and all other relevant information to becoming a tenant. Current tenants can use the Portal to submit maintenance tickets, pay their rent online, and more.It can be accesed here:</p>

<p>Since the system is still in it's beta stages, some features may not be functional at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience but assure you that we are working on getting all features and functions up and going as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Below you can find a demo version of both the Property Vista CRM and the Resident Portal to give you an idea of what your site could look like:</p>

<p>You will notice the HELP button on the top right hand side of the CRM... you can use this at anytime to communicate with us and get answers to any pressing issues.</p>
