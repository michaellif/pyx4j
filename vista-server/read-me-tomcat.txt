    Q: When uploading a WAR file larger than 50 MB,
     Get error: the request was rejected because its size (XXX) exceeds the configured maximum (52428800)

    Solution:
        Go to the web.xml of the manager application (for instance it could be under /tomcat7/webapps/manager/WEB-INF/web.xml
        Increase the max-file-size and max-request-size
