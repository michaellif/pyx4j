When using Property Vista services, you might want to consider whitelabeling a VANITY URL for your customers. In order to achieve this you will need to create CNAME record to your domain's DNS settings to customize a web address. You add and manage CNAME records using the administrative tools at your domain host, not your Property Vista console. Find your domain host for the exact steps. If you're not sure who your host is, see Identify your domain host. You can use the below link from GOOGLE as a general guide to setup your CNAME (Unless we can easily cut and paste and replicate this).
