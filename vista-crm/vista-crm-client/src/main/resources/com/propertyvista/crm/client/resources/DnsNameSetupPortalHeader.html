<p>
Your current domain is: <em>company</em>.my-community.co
</p>

<br>

<p>
To customize the experience for your marketing materials and your resident satisfaction we allow you the ability to create your own sub-domain name or even your own website dedicated to your Resident Portal. Typically, we recommend creating a sub-domain that your residents will remember such as: 
<br>
<br>
my.<em>YourCurrentWebsite</em>.com
</p>

<br>

<p>
In order to achieve the above example we would recommend creating TWO (2) CNAME records. a) my   and b) www.my
</p>

<br>

<p>
Please identify your subdomain records below and ensure that you have selected to forward them to <em>IP ADDRESS</em>. For instructions on setting up CNAME records please see examples below.
