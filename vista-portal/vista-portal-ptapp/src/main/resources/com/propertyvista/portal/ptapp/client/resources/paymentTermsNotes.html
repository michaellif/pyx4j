The account that $[PMC] is authorized to draw upon is indicated in the accompanying authorization. A specimen cheque for this account has been marked "VOID" and attached hereto. Should the cheque not be attached the authorization shall still hold true. <br>

 <br>
Revocation of this authorization does not terminate any contract for goods and services that exists between <Tenant(s)> and $[PMC]. The Payor's Authorization applies only to the method of payment and does not otherwise have any bearing on the contract for goods and services exchanged. <br>

(2) the authorization was revoked; or <br>
