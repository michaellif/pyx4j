</P>
<P>
2. In the event that the Tenants fail to pay rent in accordance with the Tenancy Agreement, the Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees to pay the rent that is in arrears directly to the Landlord forthwith. In the event that the Tenants are in breach of any covenant of the Tenancy Agreement, the Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees to pay the damages arising from such breach directly to the Landlord forthwith. In addition to the payment of rent and damages, the Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees to pay any and all costs and disbursements including any agency, legal or other fees incurred by the Landlord for the collection of the arrears of rent or the performance of any covenant.
</P>
<P>
3. The Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees to guarantee the payment of any vacancy loss claims due to a breach of the said Tenancy Agreement term, or overholding period.
</P>
<P>
4. The Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees to guarantee the payment of any damages willfully or negligently caused by the Tenants,  their invitees, guests and subtenants. In the event that the Tenants fail to rectify the damage or fail to pay for the damages, the Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees to pay the Landlord directly for the said damages.

6. In the event that legal proceedings are commenced against the Tenants herein, or an application concerning the rent for the Rented Premises is made, the Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that all documents may be served on the Guarantor by the Landlord by delivering same to the Rented Premises in accordance with section 191 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O. 2006 (the "RTA"), as amended or replaced from time to time, and it shall be the responsibility of the Tenants to ensure that the documents served are forwarded to the Guarantor. Documents served in this manner by the Landlord are deemed delivered. The Guarantor further saves and holds the Landlord harmless in the event that the Tenants of the premises do not forward or otherwise notify the Guarantor of the service of any such documents.

8. The liability of the Guarantor shall not be released, discharged or limited by any extension of time or indulgence granted to the Tenants or by any variation in or departure from the terms of the Tenancy Agreement. The Landlord shall not be bound to exhaust its recourse or remedies against the Tenants before pursuing and enforcing its rights against the Guarantor. Nothing but payment and satisfaction in full of all covenants in the Tenancy Agreement until lawful termination of the Tenancy Agreement including all extensions, renewals and overholding thereof, shall release the Guarantor from this Guarantee.

<P>
9. If during the term of the Tenancy Agreement, including any extensions or renewals thereof, the Tenants or any of them make an assignment for the general benefit of creditors, or if a receiving order in bankruptcy is made against the Tenants, or any of them, and the assignee or trustee as the case may be surrenders possession, rejects, disaffirms or disclaims the Tenancy Agreement.

10. In this Guarantee, wherever the singular number is used it shall include the several and vice versa. Wherever the contest so requires, if there is more than one Guarantor, their liability shall be joint and several.
</P>
<P>
11. This Guarantee is binding on the Guarantor's successors, administrators, heirs, executors, personal representatives and assigns. This Guarantee shall be binding and remain in full force and effect during the term of the Tenancy Agreement entered into between the Landlord and the Tenants, and shall continue in full force and effect during any extension, renewal and over holding of the term of the Tenancy Agreement by the Tenants or any of them, the Tenants' guests, invitees and/ or subtenants. For greater certainty, in the event that the Tenants are or become monthly tenants, the Guarantor hereby irrevocably covenants and agrees to guarantee the rental payment then in effect and the covenants of the Tenants for as long as any of them, their invitees, guests, subtenants and assigns are deemed liable for the Rented Premises.
