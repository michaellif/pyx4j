<div class="TenantSureFaqQnA">
	<p class="TenantSureFaqQ">Why do I need renter&#39;s insurance?</p>
	<p class="TenantSureFaqA">Answer:</p>
	<p class="TenantSureFaqA">
	Renters&#39; insurance coverage shields you from having to pay out for any damages you accidentally cause to your apartment,
	the common building where you reside, or any other resident&#39;s property.
	It also shields you if you are held responsible for injury to another person.
	Without renters&#39; liability insurance to shield you from unexpected accidents, you could lose your apartment and be liable for thousands of dollars in damages.

	<p class="TenantSureFaqQ">Do I Need Renter&rsquo;s Insurance If My Landlord has Insurance?</p>
	<p class="TenantSureFaqA">Answer:</p>
	<p class="TenantSureFaqA">
	Yes. Your landlord&rsquo;s insurance policy will only cover damage to his building.
	It won&rsquo;t pay for the replacement of your belongings and it won&rsquo;t cover your relocations costs, should you need to move out while repairs are made.

<div class="TenantSureFaqQnA">
	<p class="TenantSureFaqQ">What if I don&#39;t have much personal property?</p>
	<p class="TenantSureFaqA">Answer:</p>
	<p class="TenantSureFaqA">
	Renter&#39;s insurance &nbsp;is still important even if you don&#39;t have much personal property because of the liability component.
	Also, chances are your personal property is worth more than you think.
	If you don&#39;t have much personal property to insure, then you can save money &nbsp;by choosing a lower policy limit.
