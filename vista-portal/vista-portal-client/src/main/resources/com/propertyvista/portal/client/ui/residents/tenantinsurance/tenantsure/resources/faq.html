<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
Just as the name suggests, renter&rsquo;s insurance is a type of insurance that protects renters.
The policy pays to replace your belongings if they are damaged, destroyed or stolen under certain conditions.

<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c3">Why do I need renter&#39;s insurance?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c5 c3">Answer:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Renters&#39; insurance coverage shields you from having to pay out for any damages you accidentally cause to your apartment,
the common building where you reside, or any other resident&#39;s property.
It also shields you if you are held responsible for injury to another person.
Without renters&#39; liability insurance to shield you from unexpected accidents, you could lose your apartment and be liable for thousands of dollars in damages.

Your landlord&rsquo;s insurance policy will only cover damage to his building.

Also, chances are your personal property is worth more than you think.
