otherwise provided in an Order Form, fees are based on Service rights
acquired and not actual usage, and are payable in advance (either
monthly or annually as stated in the Order Form).  Customer shall

Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with the
provision of the Service (excluding income taxes of PVS).  If
Customer has an obligation to withhold any amounts under any law or
tax regime (other than income tax law), Customer shall gross up the
payments so that PVS receives the amount actually quoted and
invoiced. If PVS has a legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for
which Customer is responsible under this section, the appropriate
amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Customer, unless Customer
provides PVS with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the
appropriate taxing authority.</FONT></P>
