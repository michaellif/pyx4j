		<div id="AboutUs">
			<p>Welcome to Curious Kids Daycare Center - a safe, fun and nurturing place for kids from 15 months to 5 years of age. Curious Kids is a place where children learn, grow and develop their natural curiosity through play and interaction with peers and qualified staff members. 
			<p><img src="images/bksg1b.gif">&nbsp;Curious Kids is happy to inform all parents that the Centre will be engaging in a pre-school in depth preparation of the French language. Our unique pedagogical approach will allow children of all ages to learn French through a combination of play, music and other recreational activities. For parents who are looking at enrolling their children in French-immersion schools, this will provide an excellent opportunity at exposing their children to French at their earliest stages of development.

		<div id="Philosophy">
			<p>It is our pleasure to welcome you to Curious Kids Daycare. Our goal is to develop a program for children and families that would truly be a community of people, working together, providing a unique environment for the care and education of young minds. We truly believe that all children have the right for quality care in a safe, healthy and nurturing environment, one that provides learning opportunities, promotes all aspects of growth and development and encourages positive feelings of self-esteem. In our daycare each child is valued as an individual and is encouraged at the earliest age to become a responsible, independent, productive, curious and happy problem-solving person. We provide care in a non-discriminating manner, consistent with the Ontario Human Rights Code and our multicultural environment is upheld in the spirit of sharing and respect. 
			<h2>Our Goals:</h2> 
			<ul class="ffh-list"> 
			<li>Our goal is to establish interaction with children and parents on the basis of integrity and honesty.</li> 
			<li>We believe in supporting a child's socio-emotional growth by developing his or her appreciation of the beauty of our natural environment.</li> 
			<li>We aspire to help our children become active and productive members in our community by introducing them to various projects that help nurture and preserve our planet.</li> 
			<li>We aim to support and enhance the child's self-esteem through various kinds of carefully designed activities.</li> 
			<li>One of the goals of our educational program is to prepare pre-school and kindergarten age children for Grade One and to help develop their natural curiosity and love for learning.</li></ul> 
			<h2>Mission statement:</h2> 
			<p>We provide families with quality and choice in care, and have a passion and expectation for excellence in all that we envision and pursue. We strive towards excellence in the care we provide for our children, in the service we provide for our parents, in fair employment practices, the training and support we offer our staff, and in the quality of services we offer in our community to create a safe, nurturing and peaceful environment for all.

		<div id="Programs">
			<p>Curious Kids Daycare offers educational programs specifically designed for children from 15 months to 5 years of age. Our task is to provide children with the opportunity to make choices from a wide range of options, develop problem-solving skills in order to become able to take risks in a safe and nurturing environment. Our well-designed program provides a sense of security, where children are not afraid to ask questions, make decisions and explore their natural curiosity in a variety of educational activities.
			<h2>Toddlers:</h2> 
			(15 - 30 months - Staff Ratio 5:1) 
			<p>Our unique full-day program offers a safe environment for toddlers, granting the opportunity to develop the children's autonomous thinking and a sense of self as separate and unique individuals. Our well-designed program runs in a secure manner and meets the children's needs through specific routines based on careful attention to individual differences in preferences and habits. We realize that toddlers are creatures on the move. Their drive to explore combined with short attention spans means that toddlers learn as they go. Therefore our staff is always ready to prepare interesting physical and learning environments for our toddlers. At this age a lot of emphasis is put on individual activities. Our qualified staff reinforces toddler language development through modeling, books, children songs and finger play. We make sure that by the end of the toddler program and before moving on to the preschool level all of our kids are fully toilet trained. 
			<h2>Preschoolers:</h2> 
			(30 months to 5 years - Staff Ratio 8:1) 
			<p>The daily curricula, as designed for preschoolers, include activities that are meant to stimulate curious young minds in training. We believe that preschoolers need constant interaction with peers and adults as well as a variety of individual activities. As preschoolers' language skills are still developing, our teachers integrate the use of language and language materials into active play. Children are encouraged to develop oral language and listening skills through conversations with playmates and adults. We also offer materials that help our children practice writing skills and language comprehension. Our qualified staff members plan group activities that involve children in all aspects of communication. Other than the important language development activities, to which much attention is provided, our preschoolers participate in a variety of workshops that include visual arts, music, drama, science and physical education. Children take part in the preparation of various holiday and thematic celebrations, where they can share what they have learned at the centre with parents, siblings and other family members. Our preschool program also includes a wide variety of extra-curricular activities in such fields as tennis, chess, visual arts, dance, drama, foreign languages, piano lessons and Yoga for kids. Our rich preschool program fully prepares our children for Grade One and we take pride in our graduates.
